# Generate_Poetic_Text_Using_RNN

In this project there is a usage of limited shakespeare text and trained RNN model to generate the text based on the different temperature scaling from 0.2 to 1 and the model is trained for 40 epochs due to limited computational resources but the loss will decsrease more when we trained the model for longer time.
